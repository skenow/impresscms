If you feel like getting the latest "edge" version, you can checkout the core trunk at :

http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/impresscms/trunk

The ImpressCMS trunk is always the latest as-stable-as-possible development code. It is, of course, not to be used on production sites.

==Revealing the blank page backtrace log==

ImpressCMS displays a basic error page when a fatal error preventing it to run is encountered. To help you diagnose the cause of the error, this page contains additional messages that are hidden by default. To reveal them, use your browser "select all" function (for most browsers, you can use "Ctrl+A").
